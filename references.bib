  abstract = {Animals integrate external cues with information about internal conditions such as metabolic state to execute the appropriate behavioral and developmental decisions. Information about food quality and quantity is assessed by the intestine and transmitted to modulate neuronal functions via mechanisms that are not fully understood. The conserved Target of Rapamycin complex 2 (TORC2) controls multiple processes in response to cellular stressors and growth factors. Here we show that TORC2 coordinates larval development and adult behaviors in response to environmental cues and feeding state in the bacterivorous nematode C. elegans. During development, pheromone, bacterial food, and temperature regulate expression of the daf-7 TGF-{$\beta$} and daf-28 insulin-like peptide in sensory neurons to promote a binary decision between reproductive growth and entry into the alternate dauer larval stage. We find that TORC2 acts in the intestine to regulate neuronal expression of both daf-7 and daf-28, which together reflect bacterial-diet dependent feeding status, thus providing a mechanism for integration of food signals with external cues in the regulation of neuroendocrine gene expression. In the adult, TORC2 similarly acts in the intestine to modulate food-regulated foraging behaviors via a PDF-2/PDFR-1 neuropeptide signaling-dependent pathway. We also demonstrate that genetic variation affects food-dependent larval and adult phenotypes, and identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) associated with these traits. Together, these results suggest that TORC2 acts as a hub for communication of feeding state information from the gut to the brain, thereby contributing to modulation of neuronal function by internal state.},

  title = {Modulation of Sensory Behavior and Food Choice by an Enteric Bacteria-Produced Neurotransmitter},
  abstract = {Animals coexist in commensal, pathogenic or mutualistic relationships with complex communities of diverse organisms including microbes. Some bacteria produce bioactive neurotransmitters which have been proposed to modulate host nervous system activity and behaviors. However, the mechanistic basis of this microbiota-brain modulation and its physiological relevance is largely unknown. Here we show that in
            C. elegans
            , the neuromodulator tyramine (TA) produced by gut-colonizing commensal
            Providencia
            bacteria can bypass the requirement for host TA biosynthesis to manipulate a host sensory decision. Bacterially-produced TA is likely converted to octopamine (OA) by the host tyramine beta-hydroxylase enzyme. OA, in turn, targets the OCTR-1 receptor on the ASH/ASI sensory neurons to modulate an aversive olfactory response. We identify genes required for TA biosynthesis in
            Providencia
            , and show that these genes are necessary for modulation of host behavior. We further find that

            Providencia
            preferentially select these bacteria in food choice assays, and that this selection bias requires bacterially-produced TA. Our results demonstrate that a neurotransmitter produced by gut microbiota mimics the functions of the cognate host molecule to override host control of a sensory decision, thereby promoting fitness of both host and microbe.},
